# Alex-style Addition works like this -- it has a 90% 
# chance of simply returning the sum of the two numbers
# given and a 10% chance of recursively Alex-adding the 
# first number and the second number + 1. This means 
# that, potentially, an addition could be off by 1 or 
# more.
#
# Write a full program or function that takes two 
# integers and Alex-adds them as defined. You may assume 
# that your program will not stack overflow if your
# language doesn't have tail recursion. (Note that you 
# do not have to implement it recursively, as long as 
# the probabilities are the same.)
