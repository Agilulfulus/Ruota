# This is the Collatz Conjecture (OEIS A006577):
#
#	Start with an integer n > 1.
#	Repeat the following steps:
#		If n is even, divide it by 2.
#		If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
#
# It is proven that for all positive integers up to 5 * 260, or 
# about 5764000000000000000, n will eventually become 1.
#
# Your task is to find out how many iterations it takes (of 
# halving or tripling-plus-one) to reach 1.
