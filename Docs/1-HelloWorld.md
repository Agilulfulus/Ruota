# Hello World Program

The classic _Hello World_ program is very simple to implement! First, we'll need to created a file. Anyways is fine. I'll call mine `HelloWorld.ruo`.

Once you've got the file ready, open it up in your text editor of choice!

Remember, every line needs to end with a semi-colon (;)! Otherwise, the syntax might fail to evaluate.

To output to console, we use the _print_ function, which outputs a sequence of text. To use it, you call it like so:

	print("Hello World!");

And that's all, quite simple! The full code looks like this:

	print("Hello World!");

To run it, execute the `ruota.exe` interpreter with the filename as an argument. It should look something like this:

	.\ruota.exe HelloWorld

And that's it! Should run quite well.
